# Getting Started with Astro: A Modern Web Framework

Astro has been gaining significant traction among developers looking for a faster way to build content-focused websites. Unlike traditional JavaScript frameworks that send large JS bundles to the client, Astro takes a different approach.

## What Makes Astro Different

Astro introduces what they call the "Islands Architecture" - a paradigm where only the interactive components on your page are hydrated with JavaScript, while the rest remains as static HTML. This results in significantly faster load times and better performance metrics.

```js
// Example of an Astro component with partial hydration
/*
---
import InteractiveCounter from '../components/InteractiveCounter.jsx';
---
*/
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my static site!</h1>
    <p>This is static content that needs no JavaScript.</p>
    
    <!-- Only this component will ship JavaScript to the browser -->
    <InteractiveCounter client:load />
  </body>
</html>

Key Benefits

Ship Less JavaScript: By default, Astro websites have zero JavaScript runtime overhead.
Server-First API Design: Move expensive hydration off of your users' devices.
Use Any Framework: React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, Solid, Lit and more are officially supported.
Incredible Performance: Astro websites consistently rank in the fastest 1% of all websites.

Getting Started
Setting up a new Astro project is straightforward. You can use the following command to create a new project:

This blog post includes all the required front matter fields from your layout:
- title
- description
- publishDate
- featuredImage (optional)
- category (optional)
- tags (optional)

I've also added a "keywords" field, as you requested, which isn't displayed in your layout but could be useful for SEO purposes.

The format follows a standard markdown structure with headings, paragraphs, and code blocks, which should render properly in your Astro blog setup.
